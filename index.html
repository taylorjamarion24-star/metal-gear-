      <h2>What Makes Metal Gear Δ Powerful</h2>
      <p>
        The Delta trailer doesn’t just showcase stunning visuals—it captures the essence of what makes Metal Gear timeless.  
        It’s not about war itself, but the *people* who are shaped and broken by it. Snake’s world is one of survival, where loyalty is constantly tested and ideals blur into shadows.
      </p>
      <p>
        What makes <em>Snake Eater</em> special is how it turns the jungle into a metaphor for the human mind: wild, dangerous, and alive.  
        True survival, it suggests, isn’t just about fighting—it’s about understanding your place in chaos, adapting, and enduring.  
        Even after decades, that message still feels real: strength isn’t about being unbreakable, it’s about learning to rise again.
